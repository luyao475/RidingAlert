# Install Confluent Platform using Systemd on Ubuntu
Install the Confluent public key. This key is used to sign the packages in the APT repository.
wget -qO - https://packages.confluent.io/deb/5.3/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -

Add the repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list by running this command:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.confluent.io/deb/5.3 stable main"

Update apt-get and install the entire Confluent Platform platform.
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install confluent-platform-2.12

Remember to creat 'myid' file for each of the Zookeeper servers
Navigate to the ZooKeeper log directory (e.g., /var/lib/zookeeper/) and create a file named myid. 
The myid file consists of a single line that contains the machine ID in the format <machine-id>. 
When the ZooKeeper server starts up, it knows which server it is by referencing the myid file. 
For example, server 1 will have a myid value of 1.
